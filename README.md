 Model-to-observable projection code for galaxy thermodynamics.
 
>>>>>>> f2ac2341e7c22fd5884dc6a2819ed3a4eaaaadc0
 Takes in input models of density and pressure radial profiles of halos of given mass and redshift.
 
 Returns 2D profiles of observable quantities, specifically the temperature shifts in CMB maps measured within disks of varying radii due to the kSZ and tSZ effects, respectively, by implementing:
 
 - line-of-sight projection
 - instrumental beam convolution
 - aperture photometry filter
 
 Applications to:
 - generalized NFW parametric models
 - polytropic gas model based on Ostriker, Bode, Balbus (2005). 

Only requires numpy and scipy.
